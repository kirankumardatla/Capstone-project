# Capstone Project: Analyzing Booking.com Data

This repository contains the code and data files for my Capstone project completed at Datatrained. The project involves the analysis of Booking.com data and includes the following phases:

- Web Scraping (Phase 1)
- SQL Queries (Phase 2)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (Phase 3)

## Project Overview

The project focuses on analyzing data from Booking.com, a popular online platform for booking accommodations. It's divided into three phases, each building upon the previous one:

### Phase 1: Web Scraping

In this phase, we performed web scraping to collect data from Booking.com. We gathered information related to accommodations, including details such as prices, ratings, and amenities.

- This Python script contains the code used for web scraping.

### Phase 2: SQL Queries

After collecting the data, we processed it and created three CSV files. In this phase, we executed SQL queries to gain insights from the data.

**File 2: sql_queries_phase_2.sql**
- This SQL script contains the queries used to analyze the data.

### Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning

In the final phase, we performed data cleaning, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), and built two machine learning models to derive valuable insights from the data.

- This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code and documentation for data cleaning, EDA, and the machine learning models.
